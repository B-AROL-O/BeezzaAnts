**Smarter Pizza. Powered by Vision, Bugs, and Bots.**

An open-source swarm of buzzing bots and crawling code, powered by pizza, [FocoosAI](https://focoos.ai/), [Z-Ant](https://zantfoundation.github.io/Website/), and [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/).

This project was started during the [Tiny_Hack_v1](https://luma.com/59rubmuv) by the following team:

- [Gianpaolo Macario](https://github.com/gmacario)
- [Gianfranco Poncini](https://github.com/Muwattalli)

## Project Description

**BeezzaAnts** is a whimsical-sounding but seriously useful **open-source** tool designed to help **pizza shop owners** ensure every pie that leaves the oven is _perfectly cooked_ and _properly classified_.

At its core, BeezzaAnts uses **computer vision** and **low-cost Arduino-based sensors** to perform real-time visual inspections of pizzas immediately after baking. It detects:

- The **type of pizza** (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, Veggie)
- The **cooking quality** (well-cooked, undercooked, overburned)
- Any **irregularities** in toppings or appearance

The tool integrates seamlessly with a mobile application that allows users (e.g., staff or even customers) to:

- **Select the pizza type** they expect or prefer
- **View inspection results** in real-time
- **Receive alerts** when a pizza doesn't meet visual or cooking standards

Whether you're running a busy pizzeria or a cozy neighborhood joint, BeezzaAnts gives you **automated quality control** with a dash of robotic charm ‚Äî no need to manually check every pie.

### Why the Name?

Just like a **swarm of bees and ants**, BeezzaAnts works tirelessly and collectively to analyze, inspect, and report ‚Äî with the speed and precision your pizza deserves. And yes, _we also_ love pizza way too much.
